## üö¶Project
This assignment implements a traffic light system where the robot should perform a different task based on the detected colour.

When the program finishes executing, it should also produce a log of execution in a text file.

## Additional functionality
In addition to the mimimum requirements of the assignment, I have added several additional features to this project:
* Create **profiles** on the program to store prefrences such as:
  * Username and password
  * Default colour shown during search for lights.
  * Choice of mode between ‚Äúdefault‚Äù and ‚Äúemergency".
* Different **modes**:
  * **Default mode:** SwiftBot will behave normally and adhere to the traffic lights as part of the basic requirements above.
  * **Emergency mode:** SwiftBot will avoid any traffic light unless it is green. If a traffic light is detected, it should go around it in a ‚ÄúC‚Äù shape.
* **Retrace steps** that are stored in a stack throughout the program.
